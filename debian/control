Description: dracut is an event driven initramfs infrastructure (core tools)
 Unlike existing initramfs's, this is an attempt at having as little as
 possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible.  The initramfs has
 (basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that
 it can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, it depends on udev to create device nodes and
 to detect the rootfs.
 Having the root on MD, LVM2, LUKS is supported as well as NFS, iSCSI,
 NBD and FCOE with dracut-network.

Description: Initramfs generator using udev
 This package builds a bootable initramfs for Linux kernel packages.  The
 initramfs is loaded along with the kernel and is responsible for
 mounting the root filesystem and starting the main init system.

Description: dracut is an event driven initramfs infrastructure (squashfs modules)
 Package to build an initramfs with most files in a squashfs image.
 .
 This package provides a dracut module to build an initramfs, but
 store most files in a squashfs image, result in a smaller initramfs
 size and reduce runtime memory usage.

 .
 This package requires everything which is needed to build an
 initramfs with dracut, with live image capabilities, like Live CDs.

Description: dracut is an event driven initramfs infrastructure (test modules)
 This package provides the Dracut modules and configuration files for the
 Dracut test suite. This package is intended for testing Dracut itself
 and is of no use for ordinary users. If you're not sure about this package,
 you don't need it.
